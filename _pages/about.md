I am a graduate student in **Robotics and Intelligent Control** at *Harbin Institute of Technology*, with a strong background in motion planning, robotic control, and multimodal learning. I specialize in robot task simulation and control using frameworks such as **ROS2**, **MoveIt!**, **Gazebo**, and **MuJoCo**.

My current focus is on **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** learning for robotics, particularly in using large models and diffusion policies for multimodal behavior generation. I have hands-on experience in integrating **Diffusion Policy**, **OpenVLA**, and **LoRA-based fine-tuning** into real-world robotic scenarios.

I have also worked on mobile robot navigation (Nav2), robotic trajectory optimization using **RRT\*** and **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**, and reinforcement learning control in MuJoCo (PPO-based walking agents). My technical foundation includes control theory, robot kinematics/dynamics, deep learning (CNN/Transformer), and optimization.

I previously interned at **Eastsoft Technology**, contributing to robotic control algorithms, integrating **OMPL** into **MoveIt!**, and developing dynamic manipulation simulations in Gazebo.
